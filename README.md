A browser extension to track, manage, and visualize your Google Gemini chat history. It provides tools for organizing, searching, and gaining insights from your interactions.

## ‚ú® Features

### Automatic Chat Tracking
* Captures chat URL, title, timestamp (ISO 8601 UTC), and the Gemini model used (e.g., "2.5 Pro", "2.0 Flash")
* Records the initial prompt and a list of any attached filenames
* Attempts to extract the Google account name and email associated with the chat
* Prevents duplicate entries based on chat URL

### Status Indicator
* Displays a non-intrusive status indicator on the Gemini page during tracking operations (e.g., "Saving chat...", "Chat saved")

### Browser Action Popup
* Quick overview of total conversations, most used model, and time of the last conversation
* Displays a list of the most recent conversations with quick links
* Buttons to open the full dashboard, export history, and import history
* Theme toggle (Light/Dark)

### Full Dashboard Page
* **Comprehensive List View:** Displays all saved conversations
* **Search & Filtering:**
  * Search by chat title and prompt content
  * Filter by Gemini model
  * Filter by date range (All Time, Today, This Week, This Month, Custom Range)
* **Sorting:** Sort conversations by date (newest/oldest), title, or model
* **Detailed View:** Click on a conversation to see full details including title, date, model, account, prompt, and attached files in a modal
* **Data Statistics:**

  * **Activity Over Time:** Line chart showing the number of conversations over time
* **Data Management:**
  * **Export History:** Export all or filtered history as a JSON file
  * **Import History:** Import history from a previously exported JSON file (merges new entries, avoids duplicates)
  * **Clear All History:** Permanently delete all stored conversations
* **Theme Toggling:** Switch between Light and Dark themes for the dashboard
* **Toast Notifications:** Provides feedback for actions like saving, deleting, importing, or exporting data

## üîß How it Works

1. **Content Script (`gemini-tracker.js`):**
   * Injects into `https://gemini.google.com/*` pages
   * Monitors user interactions, specifically looking for clicks on the "Send" button when a new chat is being initiated
   * Captures the current model, prompt text, and any attached file names
   * Uses `MutationObserver` to watch for the newly created conversation item and its generated title
   * Saves the complete chat entry to `browser.storage.local`
   * Displays a status indicator for feedback

2. **Background Script (`background.js`):**
   * Updates the browser action badge with the total number of saved conversations
   * Handles the `browser.browserAction.onClicked` event to show the popup
   * Responds to messages to open the full dashboard page

3. **Popup (`popup/`):**
   * Retrieves history data from `browser.storage.local`
   * Displays key statistics and a list of recent conversations
   * Provides buttons for navigating to the full dashboard, exporting, and importing history

4. **Dashboard (`dashboard/`):**
   * Loads all history data from `browser.storage.local`
   * Provides rich UI for viewing, filtering, sorting, visualizing, and managing chat history
   * Uses Day.js for date/time manipulation and Chart.js for visualizations
