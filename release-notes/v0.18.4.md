# Release Notes

## Overview

This release focuses on enhancing the reliability of chat tracking, improving the user experience by preventing data loss, and significantly overhauling the project's documentation for better clarity.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Reliability

- **Improved Chat Finalization**: A critical race condition has been resolved to more reliably capture chat titles, particularly when the Gemini tab is not in focus or a response is generated while the tab is hidden. This prevents chats from getting stuck in a pending state.
- **Enhanced State Management**: The logic for managing chat state has been refactored to ensure a clean separation between new chat sessions. This prevents data from a previous chat from contaminating a new one, improving data integrity.

## 💄 User Experience

- **Clearer Status Notifications:** The on-page status messages have been improved for greater clarity. Now, if you navigate away while a chat is being saved, the status indicator will explicitly display a "Tracking cancelled" message, ensuring you are immediately aware of the outcome.

## 📃 Documentation

- **Streamlined `README.md`**: The `README.md` file has been significantly reorganized and rewritten for improved readability and conciseness. Key changes include:
  - A more focused "Core Features" section.
  - A new "Limitations & Important Notes" section for better user awareness.
  - Collapsible sections for installation and developer instructions.
  - Improved formatting and overall structure for a more professional presentation.
