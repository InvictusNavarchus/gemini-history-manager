## Release Notes: v0.17.1

This update introduces two key enhancements to the Gemini History Manager, improving its reliability and intelligence in common usage scenarios:

1.  **Enhanced Chat Detection with Hidden or Collapsed Sidebar:**

    - The extension now accurately detects and tracks new conversations, even when the Gemini sidebar is collapsed (e.g., for users on smaller devices or preferring a compact view) or hidden.
    - **User Benefit:** Enjoy consistent chat history capture regardless of sidebar state, ensuring the extension works effectively across various display sizes and user preferences.

2.  **Smarter Behavior on Tab Focus:**
    - The extension's handling of tab visibility changes (switching away from and back to the Gemini tab) has been significantly improved:
      - **For Active Chats:** If a conversation is actively being processed by Gemini when you switch tabs, the extension now ensures that this ongoing tracking is fully preserved and remains uninterrupted upon your return.
      - **For Inactive Tabs:** When you return to the Gemini tab and no chat is actively being processed, the extension re-initializes its connection to the page.
    - **User Benefit:** This dual approach provides a more robust and seamless experience. Active chat logging is protected during tab switches, and the extension ensures it's correctly synced and ready for new activity when you revisit an inactive Gemini tab.
