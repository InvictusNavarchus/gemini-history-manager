**Release Date:** June 2, 2025

## 🚀 Features & Improvements

- **Import Process Enhancements:**
  - The visual guidance for the import feature has been improved with clearer cues, including a tooltip, arrow, and a pulsing highlight effect on the relevant UI elements.
  - The timeout delay for this visual guidance has been reduced for a quicker user experience.

## 🐛 Fixes

- **Icon Display:** Application icons have been corrected by cropping extraneous empty spaces. This results in a cleaner visual presentation and improved alignment within the user interface.
- **Title Detection Stability:** Addressed an issue where the system could get stuck waiting indefinitely for chat titles, particularly if a chat generation process was manually stopped. The system will now more gracefully handle such scenarios by accepting placeholder or truncated titles if a full title is not promptly available after generation concludes.
- **Import UI Tooltips:** Corrected the positioning of tooltips within the import guided experience, ensuring they display accurately even when the page is scrolled.
- **Import UI Focus:** Resolved an issue where the import button might not correctly lose focus after the guided import process was dismissed.

## 🛠️ Internal Refinements & Technical Improvements

- **DOM Observation System:** The internal DOM observer, especially for title detection, has been significantly streamlined. This includes cleaner URL validation logic, removal of redundant code, and improved state management, leading to enhanced code maintainability and system robustness.
- **Title Detection Logic:** The mechanism for detecting titles has been simplified by removing an obsolete component. The system now relies more directly and efficiently on the modern observer system.
- **Logging Standardization:** Internal logging practices have been standardized with the use of utility prefixes and consistent formatting. This improves log readability and aids developers in debugging and maintenance.
