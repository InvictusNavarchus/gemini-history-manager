# Gemini History Manager v0.18.6

## 🚀 Release Notes

This release introduces robust Gemini crash detection, enhances developer workflows with automated scripts and code formatting, and improves the extension's reliability with a critical timing fix.

### ✨ New Features & Improvements

- 🥅 **Gemini Crash Detection**: The extension now intelligently detects when Gemini crashes or becomes unresponsive during a chat. It will automatically stop tracking and display a "Gemini crashed. Tracking canceled" message to the user, preventing broken or incomplete history entries.
- 🔨 **Automated GitHub Release Script**: To improve our development cycle, a new script has been added to automate the process of creating GitHub releases, ensuring faster and more consistent updates.
- 🎨 **Automated Code Formatting**: Integrated `husky` to enforce consistent code formatting with `prettier` on every commit. This improves code quality and maintainability for developers.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🩹 **Increased Stop Button Grace Period**: The wait time for the app to detect chat title changes has been increased from 1 to 3 seconds. This prevents the tracker from failing prematurely on slower connections, making history tracking more reliable.
