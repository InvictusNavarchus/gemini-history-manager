### ✨ Enhancements & Fixes

- **Improved Title Detection:** Enhanced the reliability of capturing conversation titles, particularly in scenarios where titles might initially appear as placeholders derived from the prompt content. This leads to more accurate and consistent recording of chat information. (Commits: `d4465f7`, `584fccb`, `2b5874b`)

### Internal Improvements & Chores

- **Automated Post-Version Bump Script:** Introduced and refined a script (`post-bump.sh`) to automate git operations (staging, committing, tagging, and pushing) that follow a version bump. This script now includes a dry-run mode for safer execution and uses an updated commit message format. (Commits: `92e687a`, `473c864`, `66c63d8`)
- **Code Formatting:** Applied Prettier to format the codebase for consistency. (Commit: `4b83a30`)
