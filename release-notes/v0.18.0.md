This release introduces a significant enhancement to how codeblocks are handled, a major overhaul of the content script logging system for better debugging, and several important bug fixes.

### ✨ New Features

- **Enhanced & Optimized Codeblock Handling**: Introduced a robust and efficient system for detecting and processing codeblocks within user prompts. This feature, now part of the `Utils` module, accurately handles multiple codeblocks, preserves surrounding text, validates Markdown syntax, and gracefully manages nested or unclosed blocks. The parsing algorithm has been optimized with a regex-based approach for improved performance and correct handling of various newline sequences (e.g., `\r\n`). (c0a6ebc, d196665, a7d50de, 0f0e5f9)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved Title Detection with Codeblocks**: Resolved issues with chat title detection, particularly when prompts contained codeblocks or when the sidebar was collapsed. This ensures more reliable capture of chat titles, using the original prompt text for more accurate comparisons against placeholders. (e7ad3f8, 4be7230, dae89c8)
- **Content Script Load Order**: Corrected the loading order of `gemini-history-utils.js` within the browser extension's manifest to prevent potential reference errors during script initialization. (c435cdd, effafc7)
- **Utility Script Availability**: Ensured the core `Utils` module is consistently defined and accessible across all content scripts that rely on its functions. (1355f3b)

### 🔁 Refactorings & Internal Improvements

- **Content Script Logging Overhaul**: The logging system within content scripts has been significantly refactored. It now uses direct `console.log` (and its variants like `console.warn`, `console.error`) calls, prefixed consistently with a timestamp and the script context (e.g., `[HH:MM:SS] [gemini-tracker]`). This change simplifies the logging infrastructure, improves the clarity of console output, and ensures that log tracebacks correctly point to the origin of the log message. As part of this, the dedicated logger class and configuration for content scripts were removed. (81e897d, 74a739e, 948056c, 9a2c2a2, e706905, 3566a64, e1f85ea, b96e5d4)
- **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed the now-unused `LOG_PREFIX` and `CONTEXT_PREFIX` constants from the internal configuration. (6d3aac0)
- **Code Formatting**: Applied Prettier across the codebase to ensure consistent styling. (55f1972)
- **Logging for Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging specifically for the title detection mechanism to aid in future debugging if similar issues arise. (d849279)
