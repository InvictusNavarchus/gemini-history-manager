## Release Notes

These release notes detail the enhancements and updates from version v0.18.4 to v0.18.5, focusing on user experience improvements and documentation clarity.

### âœ¨ Features & Improvements

- **Streamlined Status Notifications:** The user-facing status messages that appear during the chat tracking process have been significantly overhauled. Competing and redundant messages have been removed, and the remaining notifications are clearer and more purposeful. This provides a cleaner, more intuitive user experience when saving a new chat.
- **Improved Terminology:** To better reflect the Gemini UI, all user-facing instances of the term "sidebar" have been updated to "recent chats". This change ensures the extension's language is consistent with the web interface.
- **Enhanced Feedback Messages:**
  - A "Please wait..." message is now displayed while the extension locates the "recent chats" list, providing better feedback during initialization.
  - The status indicator will now correctly show an error message if the chat being saved already exists or is otherwise invalid.

### ðŸ“„ Documentation

- **New Developer Script:** The `README.md` file has been updated to include instructions for a new `pnpm package` script. This script simplifies the build process for developers by creating packaged distributable files for both Chrome and Firefox.
- **Minor Fixes:** A minor formatting correction was made to the privacy policy.
