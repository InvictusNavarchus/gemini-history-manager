## Version 0.15.0

This release introduces significant new features related to "Gem" support, URL handling, and UI improvements, alongside several important refactors, fixes, and styling updates.

### ✨ New Features

- **Gem Integration & Tracking:**
  - Implemented a comprehensive system for detecting and tracking "Gems" (customized Gemini experiences).
    - Added URL utilities specifically for Gem identification.
    - Created a dedicated Gem detector module with enhanced detection logic using multiple selectors and improved logging.
    - Updated application state to include Gem-specific data fields.
    - Enabled capturing of Gem information (ID, Name, URL) during new conversation tracking.
    - Modified the history manager to store and handle Gem-related data.
    - Integrated Gem detection into the main chat tracking workflow.
  - **Dashboard Gem Support:**
    - Added functionality to filter conversations by Gems in the dashboard.
    - Implemented display of Gem information within dashboard components.
    - Introduced a new "Gem Distribution" chart in the Visualizations tab to show usage frequency of different Gems.
- **Multi-Account URL Support:**
  - Extended Gemini URL detection patterns to correctly support the `/u/[n]/` structure used for multiple Google accounts, ensuring accurate tracking across different user profiles.
- **Copy Conversation URL:**
  - Added a "Copy URL to Clipboard" button for each conversation in the dashboard, providing quick access to the conversation's direct link with user feedback on copy success.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed issues related to the integration of Gem detection, ensuring it works smoothly within the main chat tracking workflow.
- Enhanced the Gem detection mechanism with multiple UI selectors and improved logging for better reliability and easier debugging.
- Corrected a layout issue by adding a `full-width-content` class to `App.vue` to ensure content appropriately uses available space.

### ♻️ Refactors

- **CSS and Component Structure:**
  - Undertook significant refactoring of CSS by splitting global styles into more component-specific stylesheets (as seen in `dashboard.css`, `popup.css`, and `theme-init.css`), improving modularity and maintainability. This work was primarily carried out in the `refactor/split-global-css-into-components-2` and `refactor/split-global-css-into-components-3` branches.
- **Styling Improvements:**
  - Improved code maintainability by replacing an inline style attribute with a semantic ID selector for styling elements.
  - Enhanced theme consistency by refactoring CSS to use the `var(--shadow)` variable in `.modal-content` instead of a hard-coded shadow value.

### 💅 Styling

- The codebase has been formatted using Prettier to ensure consistent styling across all files.
