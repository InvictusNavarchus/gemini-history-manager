## Privacy Policy for Gemini History Manager

**Last Updated:** June 2, 2025

Thank you for using Gemini History Manager (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension collects, uses, and protects your information. The Extension is designed with your privacy in mind, and all your chat history data is stored locally on your computer.

### 1. Information I Collect

The Extension collects the following information about your Google Gemini chats and stores it **locally on your device** using your browser's storage (`browser.storage.local`):

* **Chat Metadata:**
    * **Timestamp:** The date and time of the conversation (ISO 8601 UTC format).
    * **URL:** The web address of the chat.
    * **Title:** The title of the chat, as generated by Gemini.
    * **Gemini Model:** The specific Gemini model used (e.g., "2.5 Pro," "2.0 Flash," "Deep Research," "Veo 2").
* **Chat Content:**
    * **Initial Prompt:** The first prompt you entered in the chat.
    * **Attached Filenames:** The names of any files you attached to the initial prompt (note: the content of the files is **not** collected or stored by the Extension).
* **Account Information (extracted from the Gemini webpage):**
    * **Account Name:** The Google account name associated with the chat.
    * **Account Email:** The Google account email associated with the chat.
    * **Gemini Plan:** Your Google Gemini plan (e.g., "Pro," "Free"), if detectable.
* **Custom Gem Information (if applicable):**
    * **Gem ID:** The unique identifier of any custom Gem used.
    * **Gem Name:** The name of the custom Gem used.
    * **Gem URL:** The web address of the custom Gem.

### 2. How I Use Your Information

The information collected is used solely to provide and improve the features of the Extension. This includes:

* **Automatic Chat Tracking:** To automatically save your Gemini chat history.
* **Local Storage:** To store your chat history on your local device.
* **Dashboard and Popup Display:** To display your chat history, statistics (like total conversations, most used model, model distribution, activity over time, plan distribution), and allow you to search, filter, and sort your conversations.
* **Data Management:** To enable you to export your history to a JSON file, import history from a JSON file, and clear your stored history.

### 3. Data Storage and Security

**All data collected by the Extension is stored locally on your computer within your browser's local storage (`browser.storage.local`).**

* **No External Transmission:** Your chat history and any other collected data are **not sent to our servers or any third-party servers.** The data remains on your device unless you manually export it.
* **User Responsibility:** You are responsible for the security of your local machine and browser environment where this data is stored.

The Extension requests the `storage` and `unlimitedStorage` permissions.
    * `storage`: This permission is required to save and retrieve your Gemini chat history using `browser.storage.local`.
    * `unlimitedStorage`: This permission allows the Extension to store a potentially large amount of chat history without being overly restricted by browser quotas.

### 4. Logging Configuration

The Extension includes a local logging system for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.
* **Local Storage:** The configuration for this logging system is stored in your browser's `localStorage` under the key `gemini_log_config`.
* **No Transmission:** Log data is not automatically transmitted. "Remote logging" is listed as a potential future enhancement but is not currently implemented.

### 5. User Control Over Data

You have full control over the data stored by the Extension:

* **Viewing Data:** You can view all your stored chat history through the Extension's dashboard.
* **Exporting Data:** You can export your entire chat history, or a filtered view of it, as a JSON file from the dashboard.
* **Importing Data:** You can import chat history from a previously exported JSON file.
* **Deleting Data:** You can delete individual conversations or clear your entire chat history permanently from the dashboard.

### 6. Data Sharing

As all data is stored locally on your device and not transmitted to any external servers by the Extension, I do not share your personal information or chat history with any third parties.

### 7. Children's Privacy

This Extension is intended for users who meet the age requirements for using Google Gemini. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension or on the Extension's listing page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
